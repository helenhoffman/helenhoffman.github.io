The Word Data Scentist has been over used. From my understanding, a data scientist can be defined as:

1. He should be an expert in Statistics (ie.Applied Regression, Multivariate analysis...), Modeling, Data Mining, Professional Tools/Language (ie. SAS, R, Python, Hadoop, SQL, Weka, Matlab,SPSS...), Data Visualization (Tableau, SAS...)

2. Big Volumn of Data. Data Scientist usually processes gig bite of data. Excel can hardly handle that huge volumn.

3. He should know how to get/collect data, clearance, intergrate, process, program...

4. Finally, to become a data scientist, you need to prepare to learn all you life all the time.
