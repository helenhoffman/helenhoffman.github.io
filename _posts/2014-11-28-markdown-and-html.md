title: My Journey

It’s not easy for a professional to make such a hard decision to go back to school to refresh the battery, and pause her 12-year senior management position and started preparing for GRE/iBT tests; it’s not easy for an English Major who hadn’t learned advanced mathematics in university to study Calculus, Linear Algebra and R by herself, in order to welcome Statistics, Modeling and Programming courses; and it’s not easy to leave her family and country, fly cross Pacific Ocean to live and study in a totally different world without knowing anybody. Because it’s not easy, I extremely cherish this valuable opportunity. I believe it’s worthy to make such investment on myself. 

Eighteen months ago, my weighted scorecard told me, Drexel was the best choice for me among other 9 universities I applied, and now I still believe so: 1. Course arrangement is great and LeBow keeps on updating the courses according to the industrial requirement.  2. Strong connections in industries that students had many opportunities to meet great companies and top data scientists in diverse areas.  3. LeBow attracts talented students and encourages them to study here, where you will find a lot of outstanding companions. 4. Its advantageous location makes it a convenient place to live and attend various events.

I enjoy the time learning from all my brilliant professors and classmates. We learned many analytical skills/methodology/tools, including R, SAS, SQL, SPSS, Hadoop, Python, Tableau, Matleb, Statistics, Algorithm, Multivariate Analysis, Regression, Data Mining, Molding, Visualization, etc. Most importantly, we are encouraged to keep on exploring. For example, before starting this program, I didn’t even know there is something like PCA and Simplex Method ever exist in the world. I neither know what is model and how to choose appropriate models. But now I have a deeper understanding of the analytical world. It throws reality a light by opening an access to the huge colorful universe. Cease to study, you cease to live. Skills, Perseverance and Exploration are three most important spirits I acquired from Drexel.

Now I am leading 3 lead gen projects during my internship. I feel exited when I learn how an industry generates profit; how a company grows by making business scalable and automatic; how to conduct A/B Test; where are the problems when a platform started to shrink; how to start increasing audiences and registration number by optimizing content; what audiences like to read and what/when/how frequent to push whitepapers/reports according to their preference… Those are amazing experience to have.

I will be graduating on December, and I feel confident in my skills that I learned from Drexel, especially after participated in those important projects during internship, I am ready to welcome challenges from industry, and help more companies moving forwards driven by data analytics.





























Jekyll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Here's an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Rouge by default.

{% highlight js %}
// count to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// count to twenty
var j = 0;
while (j < 20) {
    j++;
    console.log(j);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
